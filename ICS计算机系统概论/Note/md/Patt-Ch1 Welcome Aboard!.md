# Patt-Ch1 Welcome Aboard!



[TOC]

## **1.1 Two Recurring Themes**

### 1.1.1 Abstraction

- low-level details are abstracted into high-level interfaces
- improve efficiency

### 1.1.2 Hardware&Software

- Two ways to solve problems 
- Both contribute to CS



## **1.2 Levels of Transformation**

### 1.2.1 Problems

- Natural language
- may be ambiguous, imprecise

### 1.2.2 Algorithm

**3 FEATURES:**

- definite, each step is precisely stated.
- effective computability,each step can be carried out by a computer.
- finite *有限的* the procedure terminates after finite steps.

### 1.2.3 Program Language

- High-level-language:

  - easy to human, close to human language
  - machine independent, that is, it's independent of the machine which running the program

- Low-level-language: *Assembly language*

  - easy to computer
  - closely tied to the computer on which the programs will execute. 
  - generally **one such low-level language for each ISA**.

  

### 1.2.4 ISA - Instruction Set Architecture 

*指令集架构*	***e.g. x86 / ARM / Power PC***

**INTERFACE** between hardware&software

including:

- Memory Organization
- Register
- Instruction Set

> See Ch5 **5.1 The ISA: Overview**





### 1.2.5 Microarchitecture

***e.g. 80, 286, 486, Xeon, Pentium***

- The detailed implementation of ISA.
- **Relationship between ISA and Microarch:**
  - Generally, one microarch only supports one ISA
  -  but one ISA can be supported by many microarchs.
  - How to Choose? - Trade off（权衡，折中）

- Various units.In this course, we only discuss the **CPU**



### 1.2.6 Logic Circuit, Eletronic Circuit

> See **Ch3 Digital Logic Structure**

### 1.2.7 Eletrons, Devices
